	  <h1>Apex for Youth Gala Cards</h1>
	  <h2>A mini-game during the cocktail mixer</h2>
	  
	  <p>The April 2015 Apex Gala honored three people from the Asian community: Ronnie C Chan, Chairman of the Hang Lung Group in Hong Kong; Gregory Yep, 	former Senior VP of R&D at PepsiCo; and Eva Chen, who at the time was the Editor in Chief of Lucky Magazine. The staff at Apex needed a designer to quickly develop concepts for the game. I was in charge of the visual aspect, while the content and UX was by Apex's Marketing Director.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Concepts</h3>
	  <p>I quickly knocked out 3 high fidelity wireframes with placeholder content I found on a SAT prep site. I used the red and the typeface to follow Apex's visual identity. </p>

	<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
	  <p>I encountered one of the rookiest errors in designing for print: not correctly adding the crop and bleed. I spent an hour trying to figure out how to do it, and even wrote a guide for Apex's future usage. Anyway, the TLDR is when setting up doc, leave Page Size to the desired size after cutting, while setting the Bleed, which in this case is 0.125 inches. Then, Indesign will give you a red frame in which you have to extend your design work that would be cut off between that red frame and the page size. Finally, on the print screen, tick "Crop Marks" and "Use Document Bleed Setting".</p>
