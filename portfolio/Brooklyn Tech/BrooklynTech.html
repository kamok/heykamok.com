	  <h1>Brooklyn Technical <br>High School</h1>
	  <h2>An institution safe from the corruption of wealth, status, and inequality</h2>
	  
	  <p>In my <a href="../../aboutme.html">personal about page</a>, I write about attending Tech and hating every minute of it until I left. I think if you want to know a person, finding out what makes them angry is the fastest indicator of their personal values. Please enjoy my favorite aspect of the website. </p>
	  
	  <h3>Specialized High Schools of NYC</h3>
	  <p>One of nine specialized H.S. in the city and the largest in the country, Tech boasted 5,400 students. I went through the English as Second Language program at Public School 254 before I was accepted into Tech in 2008. Others associate our academic elitism with snobby, rich kids pampered by smart boards and a legendary legacy that meant a gateway to success but that was far from reality. During my four years there, I was among the 60 percent of the student body who ate the free or reduced price lunch. To qualify for the soggy fries and rabbit-feed quality salad, a family of four must earn less than $43,568 per year. </p>

	  <h3>My life at Tech</h3>
	  <p>At a young age, my mother always made my do my daily homework before I get to play, which over time went from legos to computer games. When I went to Tech and studied Industrial Design (only high school to have a major system like college), I brought that mentality with me. Still, I had a rough time at Tech as I was constantly bombarded with tests and quizzes. Homework as a given, which took about 2-3 hours a night in addition to my participation on the track team. To this day, I still haven't done as much work per day as I did at Tech.  </p>
	  
	  <h3>Discovery of what was loss</h3>
	  <p>My first year at Parsons was a breeze. I was tired of rigorous academic work (a side effect of Tech’s academentia) and university life with beautiful women and easy coursework was sublime. But after years of incessant studying I became attached to learning. I missed the moments where you can count on the person next to you to explain the lesson when you're confused. Most of all, I missed the environment in Brooklyn Tech where I sat amongst my peers who value education more than shopping and clubbing. I found my intellectual curiosity after a year of rest. </p>
	  
	  <p>When I sat in my AP Physics B class at Tech, the American Dream resonated in the classroom. The incessant scratching of pencil on paper along with the soft thumping of the teacher’s bare feet as he paced in wait for us to finish our midterm resonated discipline, rigor, and more importantly respect for what the class symbolized : a step forward.
Since then, I‘ve been working 20 hours a week as a marketing assistant, attending Parsons full time, and getting a political position in the university student government. </p>
	  
	  <h3>The true worth of Tech</h3>
	  <p>At its core, the high school is a service that professes knowledge through a four year experience. Through that experience, academic and social, its students become prepared to contribute to society. Too often do we turn on the T.V. and see success and the thirst for knowledge being treated as "not cool". Too often do children forget that education, and more specifically cultural capital is the stepping stone to success and a comfortable life. At Tech, there was only the utmost respect for the valedictorian with a perfect GPA (which is not 100%, as he aced all the AP courses worth 120% weighted) There was no jock and nerd dichotomy; everyone was a nerd. If anything, you were shamed for not trying hard and wasting the seat that another student could've used in your shoe to get out of poverty.</p>
	  <p>Despite its <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/28/nyc-specialized-high-schools_n_5702935.html">bad press</a>, the Specialized High School exam is the fairest admissions system in the world. The discrimination suit by the NAACP and its cohorts which states that the schools are unfavored towards "students of color" is a pure political gesture for Blacks and Latinos in NYC, as they exclude the fact that Asians make up for 30% of the schools depsite being the minority amongst minorities. Tech was an oasis for the thirstiest, not whitest or richest. Even Mayor De Blasio’s son, Dante, had to take the entrance test to be accepted. That kind of environment where students of all types are trying their hardest and fully exercising their gift of intelligience is crucial what this nation thrive on: merit. The fact that money, fame, and political power can't influence admissions makes this institution impervious to corruption. This is an institution that I would contribute to. One that fills me with pride. One that stays true to its mission. One that is truly "elite". </p>
