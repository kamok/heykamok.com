	  <h1>Narwall and Design and Hack</h1>
	  <h2>Venture into the unknown and with a little desperation</h2>
	  <p> I perceive myself as a tree nourished by knowledge. There is a positive correlation between my capabilities (size of the tree) and the thirst for more resources (bigger trees need more nutrients). At the time, a junior at Parsons, I perceived a danger of being overshadowed by other trees from other more competitive jungles. I was also trying to find others with the same propensity and desire to succeed. </p>

	  <h3>Going solo</h3>
	  <p>I exited the familiar Parsons elevator and walked into the graduate students's studio space. I got my orange braclet that represents that I'm a designer and I was looking for other blue braclets (programmers) to form my team. Thankfully everyone was awkward and after the initial meet and greets, I was able to snatch a designer from Parsons and two high school programmers from New Jersey.</p>

	  <h3>Defining the problem</h3>
	  <p>At the time, I was one of the five senators that represented the entire Parsons community regarding student government. It didn't take long for me to convince my team members to tackle the problem of community at The New School. The gist is that forming student groups in TNS is extremely difficult. In addition to the barrier of entry of needing 10 members, 5/10 executive board members, Mission/Vision Statement, AND a faculty liaison, the data organization on the webpage for student clubs and activites was poorly designed.</p>

		<h4> From the Office of Student Development and Activities (OSDA) as of 5/7/2015.</h4>

		<h4>Expanded view of clubs within "Pre-Professional and Academic Interest</h4>
	  </div>
		<p>Firstly students have no way of knowing who is in which club. Additionally, information such as what the club actually do on week to week basis, can only be obtained by emailing the club-specific address which does not get checked regularly, depending on club.</p>
		<p>Secondly the page is not advertised and widely visited by students. There is a dis-organization of information on student activities around campus, and multiple channels such as the Events Calendar and Facebook groups creates a communication gap and the consequent inactivity of student events around campus. </p>
	  
	  <h3>What we're gonna do about it</h3>
	  <p>We knew that we wanted to make a mobile app that allows for students to <b>1.</b> easily navigate and browse all clubs and student organizations on campus. <b>2.</b> join without the hassle of being a verified OSDA club AND finding a faculty liaison (because why would we need a liaison for a League of Legends club?) I drew up the wire frame for the app, and Bogdan and Michael (H.S. programers) taught me the technical terms such as nav bar and hamburger menu.</p>

		<h4>Our amateur wireframes that we used for 48 hours in the background.</h4>
	  </div>
	  
	  <p>We proceeded to set up a Git Hub repository and used Source Tree (another new software that I still use) to push design and coding changes on the app. We broke up into Design Team and a Code Team, and worked independently; Design building assets and UI while the programmers set up the server to host our data (which we chose Parse) and write the application.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Coming up with Narwall</h3>
	  <p>Mid way through, we knew we needed a name for the iOS application. I educated the team on the design guidelines of TNS (now outdated after the re-brand) such as using which font and color scheme. The New School's mascot is the narwhal, which is a real sea creature that has unicorn like tusks. </p>

		<h4>On the left is our mascot Gnars. On the right is our iOS icon for the app. </h4>
	  </div>
	  
	  <p>Since our app is basically a wall with posts showing all the student organizations of The New School. Narwhal. Wall of orgs. Gnar is our mascot. Gnar's Wall. Gnar Wall...Narwall!</p>
	  
	  <h3>A working back-end and front-end</h3>
	  <p>The app needed to be private to only New School students so we developed a credentials system that uses the existing N numbers that each TNS student gets. This way, we can track who is being active in what club and use that data to help administrators verify that the clubs are indeed putting those funding to use. </p>

		<h4>Keeping the filters by OSDA, we added a favorite option for students to track the club's activity (such as new events or members) </h4>
	  </div>
	  
	  <p>Each page's owners can edit the information that they want to display. At the bottom of the club page, the user can see a list of names of the members. Each user can also have their own user pages so you can really know your fellow New Schoolers by seeing what clubs they follow!</p>

		<h4>Keeping the categories delineated by OSDA, we added a favorites option for students to track the club's activity (such as new events or members) </h4>

	  <p>What's fun about this project is that the service can scale for other schools who have similar problems as The New School. Universities in urban environment tend to have this issue, as we asked some of other attendees in Design and Hack about their college's campus life.</p>
	  <h3>We didn't even make top 3</h3>
	  <p>The judges commended us on our project idea, but the execution of the app was no good. The app just didn't feel finished (because it wasn't), and the winner's products were less thought out than ours and had less commercial potential, but was actually fun to use. However, I did get in touch with great people who would later help me get a real contract to design an iOS app for a real organization:
