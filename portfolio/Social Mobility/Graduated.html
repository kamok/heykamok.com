	  <h1>Graduated</h1>
	  <h2>Research and development strategies</h2>
	  <p>For one of my class in my third year at Parsons with Jojo Glick, a Design Strategist at Johnson and Johnson's Global Strategic Design Office, our group of three students was told to delve into the subject of social mobility; an idea that I've lived with for the past 21 years.</p>

		<h4>The Social Mobility Team</h4>
	  </div>
	  
	  <h3>What is Social Mobility?</h3>
	  
	<p>noun | origin 1925-1930</p>

	“The ability of individuals or groups to move upward or downward in status based on wealth, occupation, education, or some other social variable.” - the American Heritage New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy
	Third Edition, 2005
	<p>Social Mobility is usually measured by wealth. A typical measurement is the average income of the zip code of where you die in subtracted by the average income of the zip code of where you were born in. Additionally, a person's "worth" can be summed up by their social capital (who they know), cultural capital (knowledge, education background, skills), and economic capital (wealth).</p>
	
	<h3>Going back home</h3>
	<p>We divided the research process(included interviews, word association exercises, and free response question surveys), into three targets: Target Audience 1 “emerging audience” | ages 14-18, Target Audience 2 “present audience” | ages 18-22, and Target Audience 3 “maturing audience” | ages 22-26. I'm going to focus on talking about my process with target audience 1 where I was the leader.</p>
	
	<p>I returned to my high school, Brooklyn Technical High School, and asked my old teacher if I can come in and interview some of the kids. I gave a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xIWm2bxz55-hyQzqAsGyXQywGGWKuPcNeYXjAAypUOw/edit?usp=sharing">mini lecture</a> and did a Q&A session with his sophomore class, teaching them about the basic constructs regarding social mobility including income inequality, race, gender, and other social ideas.</p>

		<h4>Students had to write the first word that comes to their mind when they think of a given phrase. This is a word cloud from that exercise.</h4>
	</div>
	<p>My findings was not what I expected. Student's idea of happiness and their idea of success was not being wealthy. I should say their end goal is not wealth, but having a "good life" and being happy. Success is a stepping stone to happiness and success to them is having a stellar career and making a lot of money.</p>
	
	<h3>"I want to stop being scared"</h3>
	<p>We asked students in the anonymous free response "What kind of help do you want to achieve success?" and that answer was the one that hit home the hardest. When we matched responses from the other age groups, they hinted at the frustration and fear of being scared of the unknown. </p>

		<h4>At any points of our lives, we are sometimes lost and not know any of the three phases listed above. To know our goals, we have to see our own inadequacy. And to reach our goal, we have to know the path to get there.</h4>
	</div>
	
	<p>Our mission statement for Graduated is as follows: We help institutions <b> create cohesion </b>between members and ex-members of their organization by facilitating <b>the creation of relationships</b> that both extends within and beyond the professional realm.</p>
	
	<h3>Why we're not like Linked In</h3>
	<p>One of the first reaction was "doesn't Linked In do that already?" As a business strategy, we are built for institutions who want to create a strong internal community and facilitate social mobility for its members. This idea came from being a student in Parsons.</p>

		<h4>Credits to Madison for designing our visual identity.</h4>
	</div>
	
	<p>At Parsons, there is a big critical issue of development diffculties (donations) which leads to a heavy reliance on tuition for operating expenses. I correlate this to students not having a positive affinity to the organization. I believe that <b>individuals who have a positive experience </b> in an institution tend to want to contribute to its success. The sense of pride of belonging to a socially responsible, ethical, or prestigious organization drives members and ex-members to go <b>above and beyond their standard affiliation</b> with the organization. In this case, it's donating to the University. </p>
	
	<h3>Feature 1: The Wall</h3>
	<p>The Wall is a simple reiteration of a subreddit. As the moderator for <a href="www.reddit.com/r/TheNewSchool">www.reddit.com/r/TheNewSchool</a>, I believe that the posts on an Insitiution pages can be nuanced and specialized to members of the institution that goes beyond the boilerplate information found on official touchpoints of an organization.

	</div>
	
	<h3>Feature 2: Match-making</h3>
	<p>Match-making takes the concept of Tinder and places it in a mentor-mentee-networking setting. Compared to traditional networking, we want our matches to go beyond "How can I use this person to my advantage?" and go into "How can I help this person and how can he/she help me?" and stay within the organization.</p>
	
	<div class="imgcaption">

		<h4>Users should be able to filter the entire candidate pool consisting of all participating members including staff and administrators in terms of interest and area of expertise. Additonally, you can change your status to "mentor up", "mentor down", and just "networking".</h4>
	</div>
	
	<p>I take inspiration from Brooklyn Tech's amazing alumni community who raised 26M in a single year for the 90th anniversary of the high school, an unprecedented feat. Technites had a reciprocal pattern of success of seeing shadows of one’s past self. That invoked a desire to give back and help others who are currently in their shoes, an idea that we can borrow for all types of institutions.</p>
