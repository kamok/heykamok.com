	  <h1>Spring 2015 USS Election</h1>
	  <h2>Putting my Excel skills to work</h2>
	  <p>This year's elections is filled with aggressive campaigning. Being one of the few senators not running for another term (because I'm graduating!), I was tasked to clean up some of the fake votes along with Bryce Geyer and Mildred Ferrer, a PhD Candidate in NSSR and a Master degree alumnus from the New School from Public Engagement. </p>
	  
	  <h3>Problem</h3>
	  <p>The main reason why we need to manually validate votes is that Survey Monkey was used. Additionally, filters were not placed to validate data that was being input, so students, for example, write their First Name in the email column, and their student ID number column is filled with actual phone numbers.</p>
	  <p>Aggressive campaigning has also led to students voting cross-divisionally, which is not allowed under our <a href= "http://www.ussnewschool.com/constitution/">Constitution</a>. Rumors of senators taking existing student information accessed through senator power to commit voting fraud also led me to committ my efforts during finals week.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Process</h3>
	  <p>As of May 14th, we're still working the data. To be updated.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Recommendations for next election</h3>
	  <p>Using a third party organization to host elections will be the best course of action for the future. This means that the University itself should not even be involved, other than providing a list of current students with voting eligiblity. </p>
	  
	  <p>We also need to consolidate the schools Mannes, Drama, and Jazz to adhere to the Board of Trustee's vision of a School of Performing Arts. </p>
